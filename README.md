# Bitwarden/Vaultwarden Sync

🔐 Backup and restore your Bitwarden vault between servers.

### [You will need your API Keys](https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/)

### NOTE: This does not currently sync Orgnisations or multiple users.

## See [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/gabrielecabrini/bitwarden-sync/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

#### NOTE: Restoring will take a while as it purges the vault

### The backup will be stored as a tar in the `backups` folder with a timestamped filename.
